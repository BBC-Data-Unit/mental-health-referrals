In August 2021, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58085428) on record numbers of combined mental health referrals to NHS Services in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We found:

* In March 2021, monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years.
* Around 300,000 people were referred to NHS mental health services in Great Britain in March this year, a rise of 18% from the total in February 2020, the month before the pandemic struck.
* The rise is driven by an increase in referrals across England. Some CCGs, like Leeds, Redbridge and Greater Preston, have seen referrals more than double compared to pre-Covid levels.
* But while referrals are rising, the number of people receiving mental health treatment remains lower than pre-pandemic levels.
* Over the same time period, our analysis found the number of people in contact with the service had dropped by around 67,000 - a fall of 9%.
* Charities have suggested a combination of social distancing restrictions and a move to online treatments has reduced capacity.
* Concerns are also growing that a spike in urgent crisis referrals suggests people are entering the system more unwell than they would have been.
