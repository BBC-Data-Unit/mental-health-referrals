In August 2021, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58085428) on record numbers of combined mental health referrals to NHS Services in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We found:

# England:

# # Referrals to mental health services:

* Latest figures show at least 279,995 referrals were made through the 117 NHS CCGs services in March 2021, a rise of 19% from February 2020.

* Some clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) have seen referral numbers more than double since the start of the pandemic.

* Referral numbers had fallen by 27% between February and April 2020, as the pandemic hit services.

# # Urgent crisis referrals to mental health services:

* Urgent mental health crisis referrals - made when a patient is suffering a more serious mental health crisis - are at their highest since January 2019 - the period analysed.

* In all, 15,570 urgent referrals were made to crisis care teams in the CCGs analysed during March 2021.

* The previous highest total was in May 2019, with further peaks in June and July 2020.

* In some CCGs, the average number of monthly urgent care referrals in the 10 months to March 2021 is more than triple the average seen in the year ending April 2020.

# # Numbers of people in contact with adult mental health services:

* The number of people in contact with adult mental health services - after receiving a referral - plunged by more than 100,000 (-104,955) between February and April last year when the pandemic struck.

* Though these figures have improved slightly, latest data from March 2021 still shows 66,915 fewer people in contact with services compared to February 2020.

* Some CCGs have seen contacts with adult mental health services fall by more than a third since the start of the pandemic, with the highest fall above 40%.

* But other CCGs have seen the number of contacts increase compared to pre-pandemic levels, with the highest increase at more than 80%.


# # Homeless people in contact with adult mental health services:

* Five mental health trusts had seen the number of homeless people in contact with their services more than double by March 2021, compared to pre-pandemic levels.

* East London NHS Foundation Trust saw the biggest increase, with numbers rising from 5 in February 2020 to 104 in March 2021 - a 1980% increase.

# Wales:

# # Referrals to Local Primary Mental Health Support Services (LPMHSS):

* Referrals dropped sharply in Wales by 72% at the start of the pandemic.  Between February 2020 and April 2020, some 4,959 fewer referrals were received.
* But as of yet no surge in referrals has been seen in the national monthly data. The latest data from March 2021 shows referral levels for Wales roughly at pre-pandemic levels, with 6,689 referrals made across adult and under-18 mental health care.
* But while numbers have not increased beyond pre-Covid levels nationally, some individual Local Health Boards are showing signs of surging referrals.
* In March 2021, the Cardiff and Vale University Local Health Board saw 47% more referrals compared to February 2020 - a rise of 435.
* Powys Teaching Local Health Board saw referrals grow by 23% - a rise of 47.
* Two other Health Boards, Aneurin Bevan and Hywel Ddam, saw referral numbers fall by a fifth over the same period. 

# Scotland:
* Referrals to mental health services fell by 59% between February and April last year when the pandemic first broke.
* But as of yet no surge in referrals has been seen in the national monthly data. The latest data from March 2021 shows referral levels for Scotland roughly at pre-pandemic levels, with 14,201 mental health referrals made.
* But while national numbers have yet to see a surge, itâ€™s a mixed picture at Health Board level.
* In March 2021, the NHS Borders board saw 154% more referrals compared to February 2020 - a rise of 145.
* And NHS Island Boards also saw referrals more than double in the same time, rising by 110% - or 34 referrals
* At the other end of the scale, two boards - Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire and Arran - saw referral numbers in March this year fall by at least 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels. 


# Northern Ireland:

* Latest monthly data for January 2021 shows non-inpatient mental health referrals in Northern Ireland are down by 29% compared to February 2020. 

* But some HSC Trusts, such as the Southern trust, have seen levels fall by more than 50%.

* Two HSC Trusts (Belfast and South Eastern) have seen large percentage surges in the number of people receiving self-harm referrals through A&E.
