In August 2021, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58085428) on record numbers of combined mental health referrals to NHS Services in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

We found:

* In March 2021, monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years.
* Around 300,000 people were referred to NHS mental health services in Great Britain in March this year, a rise of 18% from the total in February 2020, the month before the pandemic struck.
* The rise is driven by an increase in referrals across England. Some CCGs, like Leeds, Redbridge and Greater Preston, have seen referrals more than double compared to pre-Covid levels.
* But while referrals are rising, the number of people receiving mental health treatment remains lower than pre-pandemic levels.
* Over the same time period, our analysis found the number of people in contact with the service had dropped by around 67,000 - a fall of 9%.

Charities have suggested a combination of social distancing restrictions and a move to online treatments has reduced capacity. Concerns are also growing that a spike in urgent crisis referrals suggests people are entering the system more unwell than they would have been.

# Method

We analysed figures from 117 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) in England, and health boards across Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

For England, we ignored CCGs which were created in an NHS reorganisation in April 2020, and those which ceased to exist at the same time, as it would have been impossible to compare change over time.

English data came from the [Mental Health Services Monthly] Statistics(https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics).

Scottis hdata was sourced from [Public Health Scotland's Psychological Therapies Waiting Times](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/psychological-therapies-waiting-times/psychological-therapies-waiting-times-quarter-ending-march-2021/) publication.

For Wales, we analysed data from [Stats Wales](StatsWales.gov.wales), while data from Northern Ireland was supplied on request by Health and Social Care Northern Ireland.
